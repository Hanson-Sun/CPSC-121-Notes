Propositional and Conditional Logic</h1>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Translate back and forth between simple natural language
statements and propositional logic, now with conditionals and
biconditionals.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate the truth of propositional logical statements that
include conditionals and biconditionals using truth tables.</p></li>
<li><p>Given a propositional logic statement and an equivalence rule,
apply the rule to create an equivalent statement.</p></li>
<li><p>Explore alternate forms of propositional logic statements by
application of equivalence rules, especially in order to simplify
complex statements or massage statements into a desired form.</p></li>
<li><p>Build computational systems to solve the 7- or 4-segment LED
displays, using both propositional logic expressions and equivalent
digital logic circuits.</p></li>

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<p>If p and q are <strong>statement variables</strong>, the conditional
of q by p is “If p then q” or “p implies q” and is denoted <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em> ⟹ <em>q</em></span>. It is false when
<strong>p is true and q is false</strong>; otherwise it is true.</p>
<p>In a conditional, we call <strong>p the hypothesis (or
antecedent)</strong> of the conditional and <strong>q the conclusion (or
consequent)</strong>.</p>
<p>Given statement variables p and q, the biconditional of p and q is
<strong>“p if, and only if, q”</strong> and is denoted <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em> ⇔ <em>q</em></span>. It is
<strong>true</strong> if both p and q <strong>have the same truth
values</strong> and is <strong>false</strong> if p and q have
<strong>opposite truth values</strong>. The words if and only if are
sometimes abbreviated <strong>iff</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="conditional-statements">Conditional Statements</h2>
<p><span class="math inline">⟹</span> is just like any other connective
(<span class="math inline">∨</span>, <span class="math inline">∧</span>)
- distributive laws applies to <span class="math inline">⟹</span> !!
&gt; If 4,686 is divisible by 6, then 4,686 is divisible by 3<br />
&gt; If P, then Q<br />
&gt; <span class="math inline"><em>P</em> ⟹ <em>Q</em></span> &gt; &gt;
P is the <strong><em>Hypothesis</em></strong> and Q is the
<strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong> &gt; &gt; If P is false, the
conditional is by default <strong>true</strong> (vacuously true). If P
is false, it doesnt matter whether Q is false or not, hence the
statement will be <strong>true</strong><br />

<h2 id="representation-of-if-then-as-or">Representation of If-Then as
Or</h2>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>P</em> ⟹ <em>Q</em> ≡ ¬<em>P</em> ∨ <em>Q</em></span>
&gt; Example: Rewrite the following statement in if-then form.<br />
&gt; Either you get to work on time or you are fired<br />

time, then you are fired. &gt;</p>
<h2 id="the-negation-of-a-conditional-statement">The Negation of a
Conditional Statement</h2>
<p>The negation of “if p then q” is logically equivalent to “p and not
q.” <span
class="math display">¬(<em>P</em>⟹<em>Q</em>) ≡ <em>P</em> ∧ ¬<em>Q</em></span>
&gt; Example: Write negations of the following statements<br />
&gt; If my car is in the repair shop, then I cannot get to class<br />
&gt; <span class="math inline">→</span> My car is in the repair shop and
I can get to class.</p>
<h2 id="the-contrapositive-of-a-conditional-statement">The
Contrapositive of a Conditional Statement</h2>
<p>A conditional statement is logically equivalent to its
contrapositive. <span
class="math display"><em>P</em> ⟹ <em>Q</em> ≡ ¬<em>Q</em> ⟹ ¬<em>P</em></span>
&gt; Example: Write the contrapositive for the following statement &gt;
If Howard can swim across the lake, then Howard can swim to the
island<br />
&gt; <span class="math inline">→</span> If Howard cannot swim to the
island, then Howard cannot swim across the lake</p>
<h2 id="the-converse-and-inverse-of-a-conditional-statement">The
Converse and Inverse of a Conditional Statement</h2>
<p>These two variants of the conditional are <strong>NOT</strong>
logically equivalent.<br />
For the conditional statement <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em> ⟹ <em>Q</em></span> 1.
<strong>Converse</strong>: If Q then P, <span
class="math inline"><em>Q</em> ⟹ <em>P</em></span> 2.
<strong>Inverse</strong>: If not P then not Q, <span
class="math inline">¬<em>P</em> ⟹ ¬<em>Q</em></span> &gt; Example: write
the converse and inverse of the folloing statement<br />
&gt; If Howard can swim across the lake, then Howard can swim to the
island<br />
&gt; <span class="math inline">→</span> Converse: If Howard can swim to
the island, then Howard can swim across the lake.<br />

across the lake, then Howard cannot swim to the island.</p>

<li>A conditional statement and its converse are not logically

<h2 id="only-if-and-the-biconditional">Only if and the

<p>“P only if Q” means that P occurs only if Q occurs also. This means
if Q does not occur, then P also <strong>does not</strong> occur. &gt;
If P and Q are statements &gt; <span class="math display">“P only if Q"
means “If not Q then not P"</span> &gt; which is equivalently written as
the contrapositive of &gt; <span class="math display">“If P then
Q"</span> &gt;</p>

under four minutes, then he will not break the world’s record</p>

<p>The biconditional “P if and only if Q” is denoted as <span
